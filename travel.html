            <img src = "images/Vermont-fall-foliage-road-trip.jpg" alt = "Go on a fall foliage road trip around VT">
            <p>Chasing the fall colors is a must when you’re in Vermont. Peak foliage typically occurs between late-September and mid-October, but can vary considerably between different geographies and elevations across the state. This makes leaf peeping one of the top Vermont fall activities.</p>
            <img src = "images/cozy-cabin-vt.jpg" alt = "Stay overnight in a cozy cabin">
            <p>It would be a crime to visit Vermont and not stay in a cozy log cabin. From modern A-Frames to rustic chalets, this state offers no shortage of unique accommodations with mountain views and plenty of woods to go around.</p>
            <img src = "images/Lake-Willoughby-VT.jpg" alt = "Enjoy lake life at Lake Willoughby">
            <p>Located in the Northeast Kingdom, Lake Willoughby is my favorite lake in the state of Vermont. It’s surrounded by Willoughby State Forest, which looks especially spectacular during the peak fall foliage season.</p>

Some of the most breathtaking waterfalls in VT include Bingham Falls near Mount Mansfield, Lye Brook Falls in Manchester, and Moss Glen Falls in Granville.</p>
            <img src="images/Quechee-Gorge-Things-to-do-in-Vermont.jpg" alt="See a gorgeous gorge up close">
